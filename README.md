Complete JavaScript Course 2020 Project 6 - Mapty

This is a course project I coded alongside the Udemy course "The Complete JavaScript Course 2020: From Zero to Expert" by Jonas Schmedtmann. It is a fictional workout logger application that can log running and cycling workouts on a map using an external library called 'Leaflet'.
